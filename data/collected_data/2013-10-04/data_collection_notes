RUN DESCRIPTIONS:
run001:
Straight for 10 meters at 2m/s. No problems.

run002:
2m/s, yr_c of 0.4, 6-8 circles. No problems except no data logged.

run003:
2m/s, straight, right, straight, left, stop.  No problems.

run004:
2m/s, straight, right 180, straight, left >720 then sensors stopped and bike fell.
mean steer torque is roughly 0.65 when turning left and -0.4 when turning right.

run005: saved as samples.dat
no data

run006:
1.5m/s, circle, didn't balance initially.

run007:
straight, 2 down to 1.5 down to 1, all ok. hit a bump in the middle at 1.5m/s

run008:
2 down to 1.5, turns at yr_c of +-0.4. drove all over the place.  no data. end with 286 errors.

run009:
2m/s.  start at yr_c of 0.4 then upped to 0.8 then crash.  Bike turned too hard into the turn, over corrected coming out, crashed.

run010:
2m/s.  didn't intially balance.

run 011:
2m/s.  Increased yr_c 0.4 to 0.75 step by step.
yaw rate commands:
to 0.50 at  29.1s
to 0.55 at  73.8s
to 0.60 at  90.0s
to 0.65 at 117.3s
to 0.70 at 135.1s
to 0.75 at 153.3s
to 0.60 at 203.4s
motor issue causes fall at end.  See notes at bottom of this file.

Battery check: 12.76 12.77 12.74 12.77 volts
hard reset of board

run 012:
1.8m/s.  Mix of straight and right turns.  Ends with motor problem.  Motor rattling audible after yr_c changed to 0.15

run 013:
data cut off?  1.8m/s straight then turn of 0.14.  ended with 748 errors

run 014:
rode all over.  ended with motor problem.  no data.  ended with 564 errors.

Battery check: all at 12.8V, board battery at 8.3V

NOTES:
As lean angle increases, lean and velocity oscillations increase in amplitude.  They are in-phase.  During this time, desired steer torque and RW torque are also in-phase.  The yaw rate and speed controllers would both be working to drive the bike to the commanded rw and speed, respectively.  Luke's hunch: If the sum of the currents required for both motors gets to the point where the battery cannot maintain it's voltage then... failure.


NO-DATA RUNS:
Could be due to bad SD cards.
